This project analyzes one month of Ola ride data for a specific city. SQL queries were used to extract key metrics like rides, revenue, and customer ratings, followed by data cleaning in Excel for accuracy. An interactive Power BI dashboard was then created to showcase insights such as ride trends, revenue distribution, vehicle usage, and customer satisfaction. This project helps stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions to improve operations and customer experience.
